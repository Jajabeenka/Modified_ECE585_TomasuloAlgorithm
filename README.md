This program has been tested for the given example with several differnt reservation station architectures


#INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF THIS PROGRAM:
##SETUP:
1. Define datapath architecture

 a. Define the constants for the # of Reservation Stations && initialze RS objects

 b. Define latency's
 
2. INIT PROGRAM:

 a.Input the MIPS like instructions to your given program
 
3. OUTPUT:

 a. Displays the register content each clock cycle
 b. Displays the timing of the ISSUE EXECUTE WRITEBACK at each clock cycle

###This program follows the algorithm as stated by the following sources;
